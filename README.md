## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Modes

Tuxedo Link supports two deployment modes:

### Local Mode (Development)
- All components run locally
- Uses local database and vector store
- Fast iteration and development
- No Modal required

### Production Mode (Cloud)
- UI runs locally, backend runs on Modal
- Database and vector store on Modal volumes
- Scheduled email alerts active
- Scalable and serverless

Switch between modes in `config.yaml` by setting `deployment.mode` to `local` or `production`.
